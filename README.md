## üìå Project Overview

This project is a **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** developed using Python and Streamlit. Given a selected movie, the system recommends similar movies based on several metadata features such as:

- Overview
- Genres
- Cast
- Director
- Keywords

The model uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques combined with **cosine similarity** to identify similar movies based on their textual features.

## üöÄ Features

- Select a movie from a dropdown list
- Get 5 visually rich movie recommendations with posters
- Intuitive and responsive UI using Streamlit
- TMDb API integration to fetch movie posters

## üß† Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning and Merging**:
    - Combined `movies` and `credits` datasets using the title field.
    - Retained only important columns (`genres`, `keywords`, `cast`, `crew`, `overview`, `movie_id`, `title`).

2. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Extracted top 3 cast members and the director.
    - Removed spaces and lowercased all features for uniformity.
    - Combined all the information into a single `tags` column.

3. **Text Vectorization & Similarity**:
    - Used `CountVectorizer` with a max of 5000 features and English stopwords.
    - Applied `PorterStemmer` for stemming words.
    - Calculated pairwise similarity using **cosine similarity**.

4. **Recommendation Logic**:
    - For a given movie, retrieve the most similar movies by similarity scores.
    - Display the movie posters using the **TMDb API**.

## üî• Challenges Faced & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Extracting meaningful metadata (cast, crew, genres) | Used `ast.literal_eval` to parse stringified JSON and selected only relevant people like director and top 3 actors |
| Redundancy in tags and noisy text | Cleaned and normalized tags using lowercase and stemming |
| Missing poster paths from TMDb API | Added error handling and fallback logic for broken API calls |
| UI display with Streamlit columns | Divided recommendation section into 5 equal columns using `st.columns(5)` for cleaner layout |
